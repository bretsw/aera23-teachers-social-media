### Purpose

Beginning teachers face numerous challenges as they start their careers. Although social media offer new opportunities for teachers’ ongoing professional learning through access to extra resources and broader expertise (Trust & Prestridge, 2021), these platforms also introduce new complications and challenges: beginning teachers must juggle more outlets for professional learning and potentially competing voices for what and how to teach. Through qualitative research, I explore social media’s impact on beginning teachers’ instructional practice.

### Symposium Abstract

**International Perspective on Advantages and Disadvantages of Teachers' Social Media Use**

Research suggests potential benefits and challenges for teachers’ social media use. However, it remains unclear how teachers acquire knowledge and support using social media and transfer these to their classrooms, how their social media use changes over time or differs between cultural contexts, and what pitfalls teachers face with social media. This symposium convenes an international group of scholars to present and discuss diverse empirical explorations of teachers’ social media use. Drawing upon multiple research methodologies and conceptual or theoretical framings, the five contributions address various social media platforms, teacher behaviors, and cultural contexts. Taken together, this symposium’s papers advance the field by providing new knowledge and insights into evolving and complex teacher social media use, outcomes, and experiences.
